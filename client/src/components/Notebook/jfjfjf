Hey Ken--hope all is well. I wanted to follow up. Without beating around the bush: We can't make this work.

We were really impressed with what you'd bring to table for the company and for the Goldman project specifically. You're a natural culture fit for us, have fantastic domain knowledge, and you come with a deep recommendation from a co-founder.

The biggest issue we have is that the GS team is intensely territorial. They're reticent to bring new people on, especially outside help. That introduces real risk to how your role on the project would go. Your salary would be extremely high for us, and our pipeline of new work for 2019 is solid, but it doesn't include much work at financial services rates.

We really wanted it to work but there's a lot of risk there, and we don't know if we can manage through those risks.

I know this isn't the greatest thing to hear on a Friday afternoon.

However, we're your friends, I'm glad we got to know you, and we should definitely stay in touch.

Best,

Chris
