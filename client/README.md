# Unscroll Client

I've been looking for years for a maximalist writing environment.

Unscroll is a timeline that lets you
zoom in and out using your scroll wheel
and look at different *Events*.

You can save *Events* to a
*Notebook*. Once Events are in a
Notebook you can add *Notes* to them.

You can then organize those *Notes* into
an *Essay*.

This is a pretty good way to write
things because it forces you to keep
your ideas connected to things that
actually happened.

It's designed as a timeline less for the
big events of the world but more for
triaging through millions of media
objects, ideas, tweets, books,
paragraphs, data points, github commits,
etc. in order to search for patterns of
behavior over time.

Basically an "Event" is any thing from
any API with a timestamp and a unique
ID, but you can add information to make
the events more attractive.

This is the third draft of this project.
