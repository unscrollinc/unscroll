I have a side project: A web-based, timeline-driven writing tool that
helps you fact-check your work, called Unscroll. I work on it when
@PostlightStudio is calm and the kids are in bed. I built it for
myself but believe it's worth sharing. https://unscroll.com (also
@unscroll)

The idea is: Events in timelines, notes in notebooks. Some notes link
to events.

Here are some timelines:

- Events from Wikipedia year pages
- Black history
- LGBTQ history
- Cooper Hewitt Design Museum
- Corporate press releases from technology companies
- Thousands of radio programs
- Software
- Millions of books
- My tweets
- The Mozilla github repository

Here are some essays I've written using it:

- Hello, World: https://unscroll.com/user/ford/notebooks/hello-world
- On Top of the World: https://unscroll.com/user/ford/notebooks/things-atop
- As I Went About My Merry Way (music)
- Technological Joy Transition (how we went from everyone getting access to no one getting access)

I look forward to your thoughts.
