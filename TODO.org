I have a side project: A web-based, timeline-driven writing tool that helps you fact-check your work, called Unscroll. I work on it when @PostlightStudio is calm and the kids are in bed. I built it for myself but believe it's worth sharing. https://unscroll.com

The idea is as simple as grade school index cards: write notes about events in a notebook, then arrange the notes into essays. Using it reduces my anxiety.

Here are some timelines:

- Events from Wikipedia year pages
- Black history
- LGBTQ history
- Cooper Hewitt
- Corporate press releases
- Thousands of radio programs
- Lots of technology stuff
- Books
- My tweets
- A few github repositories

Here are some essays I've written using it:

- Hello, World: https://unscroll.com/user/ford/notebooks/hello-world
- On Top of the World: https://unscroll.com/user/ford/notebooks/things-atop
- As I Went About My Merry Way (song)
- A Transition in Technological Joy (how we went from everyone getting access to no one getting access)

And here is an FAQ:

I look forward to your thoughts.
