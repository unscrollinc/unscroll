* Actual Notes

** Startup is basically:

*** Local Dev
- # nginx -c"/home/unscroll/unscroll/config/nginx/nginx.conf" -s reload
- # su - unscroll
- $ gunicorn -p /home/unscroll/socket/gunicorn.sock --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 unscroll.wsgi:application

*** Local Dev
- # nginx -c"/home/unscroll/unscroll/config/nginx/nginx.conf" -s reload
- # su - unscroll'
- $ gunicorn -p /home/unscroll/socket/gunicorn.sock --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 unscroll.wsgi:application


Nothing is daemonized or in upstart or anything.

A writing tool for people who need to get it right.



** Installing on Ubuntu

Cake to get a working postgresql. Hardly any work.

Got rid of all migrations and started fresh, with a custom migration
after the initial to set up the full-text indexes.

Took a while to get pip working, just normal stuff.
- Needs Python3.6.
- cryptography didn't want to install.
- unded up googling around until I found
  - apt-get install libffi-dev libssl-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libjpeg8-dev zlib1g-dev
- Which I installed

After that Gunicorn seems to just be running. Had to add the server's
IP and so unscroll.com to allowed hosts. Took most of the
configuration settings from the Gunicorn.

All the regular nginx stuff. I copied a bit over from the default
nginx setup to get the user/group right.

Only big surprise was that once I got everything configured right with
the proxy the ^/ regexp URL matcher stopped working for the API
proxying; just matching the API to '' worked fine.

	  url(r'^/', include(router.urls)),

Needed to become

	  url(r'', include(router.urls)),

Took a minute to figure out.

In general though getting from Mac to Ubuntu took an hour or two to
smooth things out.
