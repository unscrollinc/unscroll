* Presentation: When a Side Project Wants to Kill You
Or; Building an Inspiration Machine

Joy Carol Oates tweet

- anecdote about email
- what the hell did i actually learn
well i learned a lot of stuff, facts
and i learned how to get along in the world

inspiration is not about motivation as much as reducing that sense of fraudulence
when new tools come along we actually fight them pretty hard
these are images I keep around
there are so many people out there ready to tell you
and there are always a great number of peopl
but let's position it differently

that is inspiration is not about getting inspired
there's no magic inspirational liquid
just about reducing friction
getting rid of the sense that one is a fraud
and I think there's a general inspirational industry
that makes those little rectangles
but that if you find yourself at need for inspiration
you might want to be suspicious of them
and look at your own fraudulence not as some grave affliction
but ask yourself what tools will work 
it's about decreasing the risk that you'll be frozen in place by your own fraudulence

and I am appreciative of that
the irony is that they come to me and say, hey do you want to talk to a big room of strangers

i wanted to prove to you all that I am not a fraud
as to whether I am or not, I have my on opinions, and you are totally free to make up your own mind. thank you.

* Actual Notes

** Startup is basically:

*** Local Dev
- # nginx -c"/Users/ford/dev/unscroll/config/nginx/nginx_dev.conf" -s reload
- $ DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=unscroll.settings_dev gunicorn -p /tmp/gunicorn.sock --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 unscroll.wsgi:application
- (or)
- $ DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=unscroll.settings_dev ./manage.py runserver


*** Server dev
- # nginx -c"/home/unscroll/unscroll/config/nginx/nginx.conf" -s reload
- # su - unscroll
- $ cd /home/unscroll/unscroll/unscroll/
- $ gunicorn -p /home/unscroll/socket/gunicorn.sock --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 unscroll.wsgi:application


Nothing is daemonized or in upstart or anything.

** Installing on Ubuntu

Cake to get a working postgresql. Hardly any work.

Got rid of all migrations and started fresh, with a custom migration
after the initial to set up the full-text indexes.

Took a while to get pip working, just normal stuff.
- Needs Python3.6.
- cryptography didn't want to install.
- unded up googling around until I found
  - apt-get install libffi-dev libssl-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libjpeg8-dev zlib1g-dev
- Which I installed

After that Gunicorn seems to just be running. Had to add the server's
IP and so unscroll.com to allowed hosts. Took most of the
configuration settings from the Gunicorn.

All the regular nginx stuff. I copied a bit over from the default
nginx setup to get the user/group right.

Only big surprise was that once I got everything configured right with
the proxy the ^/ regexp URL matcher stopped working for the API
proxying; just matching the API to '' worked fine.

	  url(r'^/', include(router.urls)),

Needed to become

	  url(r'', include(router.urls)),

Took a minute to figure out.

In general though getting from Mac to Ubuntu took an hour or two to
smooth things out.
