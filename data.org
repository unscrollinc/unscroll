  have a lot of terms of use that aren't really spider-friendly and
  are contrary to the purpose of the index.

Because of my sources this thing has a lot of coverage of regular ol'
history, dead white European/American folks. I'd love to get a lot of
LGBTQ and minority history, esp. Black history, into this thing. In
fact it'll kind of be a failure if I don't do that.

It's also very easy to send me an email with some bona fides and offer
to do some legwork putting Black history in here for $35/hr. This is a
fun project built in my spare time but I can def. put, say, $10K out
of pocket to level up the collections.
