# Frequently Anticipated Anxieties and Objections

## What in the hell is this new stupid thing that I know I will hate?

Unscroll is a tool for writing. There are four things to know here:

1. There are Timelines filled with Events.
2. There are Notebooks filled with Notes.
3. One way to make a new Note is by clicking on an Event.
4. You can put Notes in any order. 

That's basically it, but it leads to a pretty useful way of writing.

Because the Events are searchable (#1) it's easy to look through lots
of them (#3) and do basic research.

Because of #3, your writing is always connected to events that
happened.

Because of #4, you can organize your notes to produce anything, like
essays or articles, or book chapters, and all the footnoting is done
for you.

## I don't get why you'd use this instead of [any other tool].

I personally want to become a better, faster writer and thinker, and I
built this platform to help me do that.

Let's see what happens.

## If I use this, who owns my work?

Sometimes EVERYONE, mostly YOU, never ME.

I'm still working this out, but here's where I'm at:

- Everything can be private or public.
- Private stuff can only be seen by you.
- When you make Events public you're adding them to the commons.
- You own your Notes forever.

Let's see what happens.

## Who are you?

Paul Ford. I'm a writer and programmer and I co-founded a NYC software
company called Postlight. I've been coding and managing publishing
software projects for years.

Unscroll is purely a side-project. I work on it nights and weekends
for an hour here or there, after the kids are in bed. 

It pre-dates Postlight. I first registered the URL in February 2010,
although but back then I just wanted to make a bunch of
timelines.

I've built it three times over four years, presented it twice as part
of larger talks, and this version feels solid enough to release; let's
see what happens.

## What do you expect to happen?

I want to help writers be less anxious--and god are they anxious--so
that they can do more thoughtful work. I wanted to make a tool that
helped you write that wasn't another empty box.

I've gone to many events where people talk about Fake News and how
they're going to build systems that fix it. That said, I doubt that
the solution to our current cultural problems, many of which were
created by software, is simply "more software."

I don't expect anything at all. Let's see what happens.

# It should be free software.

If people use it and care about it, that would make sense. Alternately
if I can't do it any more it should be open-sourced. It's built on
django-rest-framework and React. Let's see what happens.

# The data should be open.

The events sure should. Info dumps into the commons are
terrible. Let's see what happens.

# There's no business model.

There are tons of business models and not-business models. This thing
would need to get tens of thousands of committed daily users before it
cost more than a couple hundred bucks to run per month. I'm good for
that. Let's see what happens.

# This is not how history is done/there's more to history than chronology.

Yes, agreed. It's a writing tool that keeps chronology in view. Let's
see what happens.

# How will I know if the events are accurate?

I've thought a ton about it but the community will define culture
here, not the software. Let's see what happens.

# What about Nazis?

If a community forms, I'll hire moderators from specific groups that
are targeted and part of their job will be to grief the system, in the
same way that you pay people to hack your security. Or maybe we need a
$5 membership (with scholarships). Let's see what happens.

# You've already failed in so many ways!

And there's more to come! Let's see what happens.

# What would insane success look like?

Something would happen.
