# Frequently Anticipated Anxieties and Objections

## What in the hell is this new stupid thing that I know I will hate?

Unscroll is a tool for writing. There are four things to know here:

1. There are Timelines filled with Events.
2. There are Notebooks filled with Notes.
3. One way to make a new Note is by clicking on an Event.
4. You can put Notes in any order.

That's basically it, but it leads to a pretty useful way of writing.

Because the Events are searchable (#1) it's easy to look through lots
of them (#3) and do basic research.

Because of (#3), your writing is always connected to events that
happened.

Because of (#4), you can organize your notes to produce anything, like
essays or articles, or book chapters, and all the footnotes are always
right there.

## I don't get why you'd use this instead of [any other tool].

I'm not a young, confident writer any more. I want to become a better,
faster writer and thinker, and I built this platform to help me do
that. Let's see what happens.

## If I use this, who owns my work?

Sometimes EVERYONE, mostly YOU, never ME.

I'm still working this out, but here's where I'm at:

- Private stuff can only be seen by you.
- Timelines can be private or public.
- Notebooks can be private or public.
- When you make Timelines public you're adding them to the commons.
- You own the copyright over your Notes forever, and grant Unscroll
  the right to use them as long as you keep them private.

Will that work? Let's see what happens.

## Who are you?

My name is Paul. I'm a writer and programmer and I co-founded a NYC
software company called Postlight. I've been coding and managing
publishing software projects for years. I also once wrote an entire
issue of Bloomberg Businessweek about Code and won the national
magazine award for that. I've written for an awful lot of magazines
and it's gone pretty well. Plus a novel, etc.

Unscroll is purely a side-project. I work on it nights and weekends
for an hour here or there, after the kids are in bed. 

It pre-dates Postlight. I first registered the URL in February 2010,
although but back then I just wanted to make a bunch of
timelines. Over time it turned into this thingy.

I've built it three times over four years, presented it twice as part
of larger talks, and this version feels solid enough to release so
that everyone can yell at me. Let's see what happens.

## What do you expect to happen?

I want to help writers be less anxious--and god are they anxious--so
that they can do more thoughtful work. I wanted to make a tool that
helped you write that wasn't another empty box. Let's see what
happens.

# It should be free software.

Likely so! If people use it and care about it, that would make
sense. Alternately if I can't do it any more it should be
open-sourced. It's built on django-rest-framework and React. Let's see
what happens.

# The data should be open.

The events sure should. Info dumps into the commons are
terrible. Let's see what happens.

# There's no business model.

There are tons of business models and not-business models. This thing
would need to get tens of thousands of committed daily users before it
cost more than a couple hundred bucks to run per month. I'm good for
that. Let's see what happens.

# That has nothing to do with the blockchain.

It would be nice, some day, to publish Timeline hashes into a
blockchain so that people can be relatively assured that history has
not been manipulated. Let's see what happens.

# This is just another centralized effort designed to own culture.

It would be nice, some day, to imagine this as a federated service,
using it to index HTML microformats, blog posts, and tweets at the
time of their authorship. Let's see what happens.

# The approach to date-time is utterly half-assed.

Yes, it's terrible. Taking a date from, say, a filename on archive.org
and turning it into a realistic Julian time is pretty hard. There's a
lot to learn here. Let's see what happens.

# This is not how history is done/there's more to history than chronology.

Yes, agreed. It's a writing tool that keeps chronology in view. Let's
see what happens.

# How will I know if the events are accurate?

A community, should one form, will define the culture here, not the
software. Let's see what happens.

# What about griefers/Nazis/etc?

With any moderate success will come exhausting people, bad actors,
griefers, and so forth. We'll set limits, charge money, whatever.
It's not a social network. Let's see what happens.

# You've already failed in so many ways!

And there's more to come! Let's see what happens.

# What would insane success look like?

Something would happen.
